1.Handwritten character recognition is an exciting application of machine learning and artificial intelligence that involves training a model to identify and interpret handwritten characters. In this project, we utilized Google Colab, a cloud-based development environment, to build and train a handwritten character recognition system
2.The "Linear Regression Analysis in Google Colab" program is a data analysis and machine learning project that leverages the power of Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. In this program, I developed a Linear Regression model to analyze and predict the relationship between two or more variables.
